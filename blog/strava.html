  <h2>Finding Similar Strava Activities</h2>

  <p>As a serious runner I am a huge fan of Strava
     which I use to track my <a href='https://strava.com/athletes/1840470' target='blank'>training</a>.
   </p>
   <p>
     Strava has a feature called <a href='http://blog.strava.com/how-many-matched-runs-you-have-9021/' target='blank'>
       matched runs</a> whereby you can see if you've run the same route before and track your progress over time.
       However often I want to try and find similar <i>activities</i> (potentially with a similar route but not necessarily).
       For example if I've just done a 5 mile tempo run I might want to find other similar workouts.
   </p>
   <p>I therefore set out to try do this and using the Strava <a href='https://strava.github.io/api/' target='blank'>API</a>
      and some machine learning techniques.</p>


  <h3>Extracting and Cleaning Data</h3>
  <p>
    I extracted my activity data (including distance, activity type, speed, etc) from the Strava API
    along with the latitude and longitude coordinates from the run. I have
  </p>

  <h3>Creating a Similarity Metric</h3>
  <p>
    There are a couple of main ways two running activities can be similar. Either they could have a similar
    route or they could have been similar types of runs with similar statistics. For example
  </p>

  <h4>Finding Activities with Similar Routes</h4>
  <p>
    Rather than finding activities with exactly the same route (and hence having a very similar distance)
    I also wanted to find activities where the routes matched up for part of the run. I could not find
    a huge amount of information on the internet but inspired by the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_distance'>
      Hausdorff distance</a> I decided to calculate the average minimum distance from one path to the other.
    More formally given paths $ X = {x_1, \cdots,  x_n}, Y = {y_1, \cdots, y_m} $ I calculated
    <div style='text-align: center'><span>$ dist(X, Y) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n min_{y \in Y} |x_i - y_i|}{n}$</span></div><br>
    Note that this is not commutative: $dist(X, Y) \neq dist(Y, X) $. Hence a true similarity measure will need to take
    both values into account.
  </p>
  <p>
    Calculating this distance metric for a pair of Strava activities takes $ O(nm) $ time. My activities have around
    500-1000 coordinate pairs so I subset these by only taking every tenth coordinate to speed this up by 100x as
    previously it was taking a little too long. While this increased the metric it did so systematically.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following map is a demo of the calculation.
